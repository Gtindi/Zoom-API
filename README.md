<h1> ZOOM APIs </h1>
The endpoints for 'index.js' code are/api/meetings.
<ul>
Assuming that the front-end developer wants to interact with the Zoom API endpoints, the following endpoints would be relevant:
<li> POST /api/meetings: This endpoint creates a new Zoom meeting by making a request to the Zoom API and saves the meeting 
details to a MongoDB database. The front-end developer can send a POST request to this endpoint with the meeting details in the 
request body to create a new meeting. The response will contain the details of the newly created meeting.
</li>
</ul>
